Tutorials
- rook: a 2d to 3d tutorial, with a 3d detail added
- basic_b0: an imported 3d geom model tutorial with block splitting

## toy cases
Small cases to help diagnose what can go wrong
- lots of boxes: we should have a grid of hexahedra, connected all throughout. Check what is wrong with the issue detection tool and sheet exploration.
- out of bounds: only the skin of the mesh is displayed; an apparently good mesh might be bad.
- uniform: 2d case; display the surface mesh, it looks like a regular grid, but it is not.

## examples
- s45: this example starts from a block associated to a part of the geom model and the blocking is then extended to capture all the entities. Contains a script.
- s39 (unfinished): the starting point is a single block the size of the bounding box. Contains an unfinished script.
- exemples.stp: several relatively simple volumes.
